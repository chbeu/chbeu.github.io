There are great talks&amp;mdash;of course. Yet, meeting people and talk about research&amp;mdash;and life, the universe and everything&amp;mdash;that&amp;rsquo;s equally important and equally interesting.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Today, I was chairing a session &lt;a href="https://programs.sigchi.org/chi/2022/program/session/73420" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trust, Recommendation, and Explanable AI (XAI)&lt;/a> where we had five excellent talks. Further, I participated in the &lt;a href="https://programs.sigchi.org/chi/2022/program/session/81226" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Social Justice 1: Towards a Collective Manifesto&lt;/a> session, where we started a collective manifesto to make room for solidarity across the CHI community. This session was organized by the Social Justice Co-Chairs, where we (the Allyship Co-Chairs) were happy to team up with. Tomorrow, we&amp;rsquo;ll continue with the &lt;a href="https://programs.sigchi.org/chi/2022/program/session/81227" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Social Justice 2: The Intersection of Allyship and Social Justice&lt;/a>, where we open up room for expanding the notion of allyship.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On Wednesday, the Allyship Co-Chairs organize the &lt;a href="https://programs.sigchi.org/chi/2022/program/session/82030" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Allyship Fireside Chat&lt;/a>, where we will discuss what it means to be an ally and to create a supportive CHI community. We aim at generating discussion and suggestions on how to be a supportive community member.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Do you want to be an ally&amp;mdash;a better ally? Please follow the &lt;a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9mxzhRFUHfPhngNeNLsrec4UBblJo_X_" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube Allyship Crash Course&lt;/a>. We have also created a &lt;a href="https://bit.ly/38f8Eay" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Quiz module&lt;/a> to accompany the &lt;a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9mxzhRFUHfPhngNeNLsrec4UBblJo_X_" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Crash Course&lt;/a>.
Have a look at this &lt;a href="https://chi2022.acm.org/2022/04/30/allyship-crash-course-quiz-and-fireside-chat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CHI blog for a summary&lt;/a> of these activities.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The atmosphere in New Orleans is great, too. And I am looking forward to explore the city after the conference.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
