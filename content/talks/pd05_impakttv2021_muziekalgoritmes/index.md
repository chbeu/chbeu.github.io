summary: Panel discussion with Wilbert Mutsaers (Spotify) on Music and Algorithms at IMPAKT TV, co-located with Dutch Media Week 2021.
abstract: "Data and algorithms have totally transformed the playing field for experiencing music. How do they generate the recommendations? What role do AI and algorithms play? And how important in this process are the pluggers, recording companies and streaming service editors? For this IMPAKT TV broadcast in partnership with Dutch Media Week weâ€™ll be putting these questions to two experts: Wilbert Mutsaers, head of Spotify Benelux, and Christine Bauer, Assistant Professor on Human-Centered Computing at Utrecht University."
