summary: Invited talk at the Music and Audio Research lab---a research school within New York University.
abstract: "Algorithmic curation has been adopted by online music platforms to assist listeners in navigating the huge catalogs of music recordings. An ideal music recommender system is meant to propose “the right music, to the right user, at the right moment”. But what happens if the music recommender is not *ideal*?


In this talk, I will present recent research on the artists’ perspective on music recommenders. What do artists consider fair? Are algorithms a burden or a solution? In particular, I will zoom in on research on gender bias in music recommenders."
