abstract: "This volume of CEUR-WS proceedings includes papers of the 3rd Music Recommender Systems Workshop (MuRS 2025). The workshop is co-located with the 19th ACM Conference on Recommender Systems (RecSys 2025) in Prague, Czech Republic.The MuRS workshop series aims to foster dialog among the diverse research communities addressing the challenges of music recommender systems. By bringing together researchers and practitioners from various disciplines, spanning both academia and industry, the workshop seeks to bridge gaps between the communities, encourage discussions on future research directions and advance the field.We received 21 paper submissions. Each paper submission was reviewed by at least two members of our program committee. After a rigorous evaluation process, nine papers were selected for publication in this volume and will be presented during the workshop.We thank the members of the program committee for their thoughtful reviews and constructive feedback.We also warmly thank the authors for their valuable contributions and sharing their work with the community."
