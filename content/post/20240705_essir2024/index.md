I had a great time at [ELLIS ESSIR 2024](https://2024.essir.eu) in Amsterdam. It was already the 15th edition of the European Summer School on Information Retrieval (ESSIR); for me, it was the first time.
I had the pleasure of teaching a session on 'How to do reviews', which I prepared with [Olivier Jeunen](https://olivierjeunen.github.io).

As the [12th edition of our PhD Symposium on Future Directions in Information Access (FDIA 2024)](https://2024.essir.eu/fdia-2024) was held in conjunction with ESSIR 2024 and my session's topic was aligned with the FDIA audience, the session had a double role: a lecture for ESSIR and a keynote for FDIA. Two at one go 😃

There were so many interesting lectures at the summer school, and I learned a lot myself.

Unfortunately, Olivier could not make it to ESSIR. So, I am even more looking forward to holding the session 'Fantastic Reviews—and how to write them' together with him at the [ACM Summer School on Recommender Systems](https://acmrecsys.github.io/rsss2024/) in October.
