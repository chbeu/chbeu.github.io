I am pleased to share that I am featured in **three episodes** of the radio/podcast series [Confirm Humanity---Epochenbruch](https://freiesradio.at/sendungen/confirm-humanity/), produced by [Freies Radio Salzkammergut](https://freiesradio.at). Hosted by **[Mario Friedwagner](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mario-friedwagner-312688b6/)**, the series brings together perspectives from research, education, arts, and cultural practice to reflect on the societal implications of digital transformation.

Across three (of five) episodes, I contribute from the perspective of my research on recommender systems and AI in music and media, looking at fairness, human agency, and how technology intersects with social justice, education, and creative work.

## Episode 2/5: Soziale Gerechtigkeit (Social Justice)

This episode focuses on **social justice in data-driven societies**. We discuss how data and algorithms are often seen as "neutral", while in reality they reflect the society that produces them---and can reproduce and reinforce existing inequalities.

I discuss how recommender systems in music and media affect visibility and access, and why fairness is not just about the data---it is about understanding the whole system and requires critical reflection on **datasets, algorithms, and their social embedding**.

## Episode 4/5: Bildung und Arbeit (Education and Work)

This episode addresses **education and work** in the context of increasing automation and the use of AI. The discussion focuses on how algorithmic tools are introduced as decision-support systems, often under the promise of efficiency or optimization.

A key concern throughout the episode is **human agency**. We talk about who decides what matters, who evaluates results, and why critical thinking and reflection are just as important as technical skills.

## Episode 5/5: Kunst und Künstliche Intelligenz (Art and AI)

The final episode discusses **art, culture, and artificial intelligence**. We explore how generative AI is changing creative work, from new ways of artistic practice, creative processes, and cultural production to practical questions around workflows, administration, accessibility, and copyright.

We also touch on the tensions around rights **authorship, intellectual property, data use, and value creation**, and the current dynamics around generative AI in the music sector that range from enthusiasm and exploration to hesitancy and "tech panic".
