Just came home from a productive and inspiring week at Dagstuhl.

Different to the Dagstuhl *Seminars* I attended, we had a Dagstuhl *Perspectives Workshop* this time. Elaborating and writing a Manifesto with 22 authors is no easy task.---Fortunately, we moved forward together. It will take a bit until the Manifesto is published. Stay tuned!

Thank you to my co-organizers of this [Dagstuhl Perspectives Workshop 24352: Conversational Agents: A Framework for Evaluation (CAFE)](https://www.dagstuhl.de/24352): [Li Chen](https://www.comp.hkbu.edu.hk/~lichen/), [Nicola Ferro](https://www.dei.unipd.it/~ferro/), and [Norbert Fuhr](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=p53Ht7UAAAAJ).
And, of course, thank you to all participants who contributed with their insights and experience.
I'm looking forward seeing our manifesto published---and the proposed framework widely adopted by the research community.
