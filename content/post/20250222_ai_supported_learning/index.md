New year---new events.
We are organizing a networking symposium on 'AI-Supported Learning'.
The event is organized by the focus area [InterMediation. Music---Effect---Analysis | Inter-University Organization Wissenschaft & Kunst](https://w-k.sbg.ac.at/en/intermediation-music-effect-analysis-2024-28/) and will focus on current research, development and applied projects in Salzburg.

The symposium will take place in Schloss Frohnburg---Salzburg, Austria---on March 14, 2025.

After an open call for contributions, we are currently putting together the program. I am looking forward to an inspiring event.
