It is a great honor to chair the [ECIR 2026](https://ecir2026.eu) Short Paper Track together with [Sean McAvaney](https://macavaney.us) and [Mohammad Aliannejadi](https://aliannejadi.com).

The [Call for Short Papers](https://ecir2026.eu/calls/call-for-short-papers) was just released. We look forward to receiving your great :) submissions. Deadlines typically approach sooner than appreciated---so better get started ;)

Also, the calls for the other tracks are available the [conference website](https://ecir2026.eu).
