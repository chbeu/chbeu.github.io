I am happy to share that [episode \#8 of the Recsperts podcast](https://www.recsperts.com/episodes/8-music-recommender-systems-fairness-and-evaluation-with-christine-bauer) was released. 
[Marcel Kurovski](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcel-kurovski/), who hosts this podcast, has invited me to talk about my research on recommender systems.


And so we did. We discuss the specifics of recommenders in the music (streaming) domain, my research on fairness from the artists' perspective, and the importance of multi-method evaluation. I also share my view on the opportunities of leveraging context awareness for recommender systems.

It has been a nice conversation, and I hope the audience will enjoy it too.
