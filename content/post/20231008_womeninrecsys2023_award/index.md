[Eva Zangerle](https://evazangerle.at) and me received the Women in RecSys Journal Paper of the Year Award 2023 for our paper [Evaluating Recommender Systems: Survey and Framework](/publications/zangerle-2022-fevr)â€”yay!

It was both an honor and a pleasure presenting our work in the main program of RecSys 2023 in Singapore. I am also glad that Eva's "surprise appearance" worked out well :)
