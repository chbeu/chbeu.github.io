I am involved in the organization of two [RecSys](https://recsys.acm.org/recsys25/) workshops.

I am happy that MuRS---the [Music Recommender Systems Workshop](https://sites.google.com/view/murs-2025)---goes into its 3rd edition. I organize this workshop together with [Andr√©s Ferraro](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=WQglBowAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Lorenzo Porcaro](https://lorenzoporcaro.me/).

Also the collaboration with [Eva Zangerle](https://evazangerle.at) and [Alan Said](https://www.alansaid.com) continues. Together, we will organize a new workshop called [Beyond Algorithms: Reclaiming the Interdisciplinary Roots of Recommender Systems (BEYOND 2025)](https://beyondrecsys.github.io/2025/).

Stay tuned!  The CfPs will soon be available at the workshop websites.
