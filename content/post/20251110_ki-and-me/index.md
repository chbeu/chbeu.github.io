🌟 Reflecting on an incredible series of events! 🌟 

Last week week, we had the honor of hosting three thought-provoking discussions on the intersection of AI and society: **KI + ALLTAG (AI + Everyday Life)**, **KI + MACHT (AI + Power)**, and **KI + GEFÜHLE (AI + Feelings)**. These three events were enriched by the insights of our amazing speakers: [Astrid Weiss](https://astridweiss.net/), [Roland Kwitt](https://rkwitt.github.io/), [Esther Goernemann](https://www.weizenbaum-institut.de/portrait/p/esther-goernemann/), [Klaus Uhrig](https://www.reporter-forum.de/reporterinnen-workshop/reporterinnen-workshop-2022/rewo22-programm/klaus-uhrig-1), [Sabine T. Köszegi](https://www.tuwien.at/mwbw/im/ao/team/koeszegi-sabine), and [Bernhard Maurer](https://realities.fh-salzburg.ac.at/de/team/bernhard-maurer/).

The discussions followed the deeply entertaining, rich, and thought-provoking Sitcom-style theater performance **ICH HASSE MENSCHEN** (https://www.argekultur.at/Event/17469/ich-hasse-menschen) by Lena Rucker, Nils Corte, and Yvonne Schäfer. It truly set the stage for meaningful dialogue. 
Having seen the performance twice, I was amazed by how many new aspects I could explore and appreciate during my second viewing. 😁

I am grateful for the collaboration between [ARGEkultur Salzburg](https://www.argekultur.at) and the focus area [(Inter)Mediation. Music---Effect---Analysis](https://w-k.sbg.ac.at/intermediation-musik-wirkung-analyse-2024-2028/) at the Inter-University Organization [Wissenschaft & Kunst](https://w-k.sbg.ac.at/) that made these discussions possible. Thank you, Sebastian Linz, for your trust. The program we envisioned came to life in a powerful way, and I could not be happier with how it all unfolded. A huge thank you to everyone who participated - you are all amazing! 

A special thanks also goes to [FS1 Community TV Salzburg](https://fs1.tv) for live-streaming the discussions and making recordings available for those who could not join us live. You can find the recordings at the following links:
