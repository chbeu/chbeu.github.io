It is a great honor giving the keynote address at the [Second Workshop on Simulations for Information Access (Sim4IA 2025)](https://sim4ia.org/sigir2025/), collocated with SIGIR 2025 in Padua: [From toy models to tactics: What user simulation is good for](/talks/kn07_sim4ia2025).

It will be my first time attending SIGIR---yes, really! And I am very much looking forward to it.
