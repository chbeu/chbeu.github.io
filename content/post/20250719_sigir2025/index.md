Just returned from an inspiring [SIGIR 2025](https://sigir2025.dei.unipd.it) in Padua, Italy.

It was my very first time attending SIGIR---yes, really!---and I enjoyed it!

On Wednesday early (!) morning, we had a [TOIS](https://dl.acm.org/journal/tois/editorial-board) AE meeting. It was great meeting my Co-AEs in person.

On Thursday, I had the great honor giving the keynote address at the [Second Workshop on Simulations for Information Access (Sim4IA 2025)](https://sim4ia.org/sigir2025/) entitled: [From toy models to tactics: What user simulation is good for](/talks/kn07_sim4ia2025). It was an inspiring workshop with a "getting things done" spirit.
