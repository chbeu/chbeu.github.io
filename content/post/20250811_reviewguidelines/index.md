Olivier Jeunen and I teamed up to tackle a topic that is close to our hearts: **how to write a great review or meta-review**. 

If you've ever submitted a paper, you probably remember the feeling of opening your reviews. Sometimes it's encouragingâ€”clear feedback, thoughtful comments, and constructive suggestions. But other timesâ€¦ it can feel like someone dismissed years of your work with a casual *"meh"* in three vague sentences.
Thatâ€™s the problem: a bad, unconstructive, or unfair review doesn't just fail to help the authorsâ€”it can be deeply demotivating. And in a community like ours, that's a cost we can't afford. We want researchers to feel inspired to improve their work, not disheartened into silence.

That's why [Olivier Jeunen](https://olivierjeunen.github.io) and I created *practical, experience-based guides* on **how to write a good (meta-)review**, developed for [RecSys 2025](https://recsys.acm.org/recsys25/).

While these slide decks are tailored to our beloved RecSys conference, most of the tips apply equally well to adjacent fields---and, in fact, to *any* research community where conference papers undergo a peer-review process. We hope they help reviewers bring fairness, clarity, and encouragement into their feedback:

These guides build on the shared wisdom of colleagues across disciplines---plus the lessons we've learned from years of reviewing (and, yes, reading our fair share of disappointing reviews).

Working with Olivier---multiple-time winner (and current record holder!!) of the [RecSys Best Reviewer Award](https://recsys.acm.org/recsys-best-reviewers/)---was a joy. Together, we've also run tutorials on good reviewing practices at ESSIR 2023 and the RecSys Summer School 2024.

Here's to the next generation of reviewers: thoughtful, fair, and constructive. Because behind every paper is a human being who deserves feedback that makes their work stronger---not their motivation weaker. ðŸš€
