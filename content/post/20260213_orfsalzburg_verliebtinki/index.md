With Valentine's Day approaching, ORF Salzburg ran a special feature exploring how people form emotional connections with AI companions. I was honored to contribute to the article [Verliebt in KI: Wie Chatbots Herzen erobern](https://salzburg.orf.at/stories/3338422/) and to discuss the topic live on ORF Radio Salzburg's Mittagszeit with [Sabine Viktoria Schneider](https://drsabineschneider.com) and [Martin Ferdiny](https://der.orf.at/unternehmen/who-is-who/tv/ferdiny104.html).

During the broadcast, we explored what it means when people experience emotions toward AI companions---a timely reflection on the intersection of AI, emotions, and human behavior, and how technology shapes the way we connect.

You can listen to the radio feature for the next 30 days here: [Mittagszeit on ORF Radio Salzburg](https://sound.orf.at/radio/sbg/sendung/52737/mittagszeit)
