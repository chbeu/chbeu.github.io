Inspired by the end-of-year reviews of [Michael Ekstrand](https://md.ekstrandom.net/blog/2023/12/2023) and [Matt Kelly](https://log.lab.matkelly.com/year-in-review-2023), I gave it a go for myself last year too.---And here is my end-of-year review for 2024.

Again, it has been a full year with many ups---yet, also downs.

## My personal highlights
- 2 times at Dagstuhl---spending the evenings in the music room with my beloved music-RecSys friends 🎶🙂
- From my home country, I traveled for work to Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, and The Netherlands. Particularly nice: 2 weeks in sunny Bari in autumn.
- The collaboration with [Andrés Ferraro](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=WQglBowAAAAJ) on bias mitigation in music recommender systems is growing big. We have joined forces with [Michael Ekstrand](http://md.ekstrandom.net) and Samira Vaez Barenji. Stay tuned! 💪
- Giving a talk at the big stage of Teatro Petruzzelli was an incomparable experience for me. I mean, on a big (!) stage in a beautiful, venerable theater, full of people, even people sitting on the balconies of the theater!
