It was a great pleasure participating in the panel titled "Algorithms of inequality? Gender, discrimination and power in AI" at the [Technology Talks Austria 2025 (#TEC25)](https://technologytalks.ait.ac.at) by AIT Austrian Institute of Technology.
We had a vivid discussion with wonderful panelists: Irina Nalis, Yufang Hou, Teki Akuetteh (Ms.), and Virginia Dignum, moderated by Elka Xharo.

The workshop (and panel) was organized by the [Federal Ministry of Women, Science and Research](https://www.bmfwf.gv.at/en.html) and Federal Minister Eva-Maria Holzleitner delivered the welcome address.
