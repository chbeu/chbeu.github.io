I am happy to announce that we have several vacant positions (at PhD and Postdoc level) to work with us within the framework of the EXDIGIT Research College at the University of Salzburg.
EXDIGIT stands for "Excellence in Digital Sciences and Interdisciplinary Technologies". In this interdisciplinary endeavor, we emphasize bridging the existing research areas and represented disciplines at the faculty. 

I seek candidates to work with me on topics related to **fairness of algorithmic decision-making** and **adaptation and personalization**---specifically in the **recommender systems** field. Interest in researching these topics in the music or media sector is a particular asset.
I expect the ability and interest to employ both **computational research approaches** (e.g., offline evaluation in recommender systems research, data analysis of large data sets) as well as **experimental (user) studies** (e.g., controlled experiments in the lab or online settings).

**The closing date for applications is 31 July 2023.**

In addition to positions related to my favorite research topics, the EXDIGIT Research College has further vacancies on a wide set of topics (both at PhD and Postdoc level). For details, please refer to the full vacancy description.
