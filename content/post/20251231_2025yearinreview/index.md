Inspired by the end-of-year reviews of [Michael Ekstrand](https://md.ekstrandom.net/blog/2023/12/2023) and [Matt Kelly](https://log.lab.matkelly.com/year-in-review-2023), I wrote my first one last year: [Year in Review 2024](/post/20241231_2024yearinreview)---and here is my Year in Review 2025.

*As there is not official abbreviation of our university's name (University of Salzburg), I use my own: USBG.*

Similar to last year, my year was full---but in different ways. Again, with ups and downs...

## My personal highlights
- From my home country, I traveled to Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, and Italy. 🚂✈️
- It was inspiring to share a panel with no less than Josh., Scharmien Zandi, Peter Vieweger, Tamara Ofenauer-Haas, and Irene Suchy, discussing AI in the live music sector.
- As part of a lecture series at our faculty, I had the opportunity to give a brief academic survey of my career and current interests. With my music background and focus, I had to end with a small sax 🎷 feature. It was a great honor to play a tune with [Martin Losert](https://mlosert.wordpress.com) and [Gerald Seilinger](https://geraldseilinger.webador.at). We played "The 🐔"---hihi.
- I declared myself "Chief Tuning Officer" in the collaboration with Andrés Ferraro, Michael Ekstrand, and Samira Vaez Barenji. A delight to keep the servers busy. 🤩

## Building a team
- At EXDIGIT:

  - Valdy Wiratama joined the team as a doctoral researcher. 👋
  - Alessia Preziosa from Politecnico di Bari spent 6 months with the team as a Visiting Researcher to work on her master's thesis---and she graduated in October. Congrats! 🥳 
  - One PhD position is still open.
- At InterMediation:
  - During my time as a Co-Lead of the focus area InterMediation, I aimed to uphold and build on the group's established traditions and working practices---while still bringing a fresh twist. I am delighted that everyone on our eight-person team is so motivated and engaged!
  - Each team member brings their own focus and moves it forward. We put a great program into place.


## Other happiness
- After Udo K. mentioned in passing that he uses his winter break to book concert tickets for the whole year, I was inspired to do the same...
  - I enjoyed the theater play Luziwuzi with Tom Neuwirth in the leading role for a second time (with my mum!).
  - Jamiroquai live on stage again---I had a blast!
  - Mnozil Brass is touring again, and I had a great time attending their Johann Strauß special program in Salzburg.
- When someone interrupts a meeting with, "I just want to tell you: I really enjoy working with you all!", it gave me so much joy and motivation to keep going! I was genuinely touched. And you know what?! I enjoy working with the team too!


## The downsides
- I've struggled to bring a detrimental campaign against me to a tolerable close; it began last year.
- I also faced great difficulty managing a situation involving serious allegations. Despite seeking help, I encountered repeated delays until it escalated. I'm relieved the escalation has ended, but unfortunately the broader matter remains unresolved, and the damage persists.


## Wrap-up
- I'm pretty sure I've forgotten a thing or two---or three.  
- Thank you to those who offered support and kept their promises---not just words, but real help.
- I made it through the year, and that's the most important achievement!
