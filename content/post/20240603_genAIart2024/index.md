I am looking forward to the symposium on 'Harmony & Dissonance: Generative AI in Music and the Arts', which I am organizing as part of the W&K collaboration between Mozarteum University and the University of Salzburg. The symposium will take place in Villa Vicina---Salzburg, Austria---on June 20, 2024.

I am delighted that to have brilliant speakers at the symposium that look at the topic from different angles:
composer and sound artist Marco DÃ¶ttlinger, copyright expert Noah Martin, media artist Stephanie Meisl, music technology and AI expert Jordi Pons, and music business researcher Peter Tschmuck.
