To strengthen our interdisciplinary research team, we seek a PhD candidate (30h/week; for 4 years) with a focus on **recommender systems** and an interest in **fairness**.  

Candidates are expected to integrate well into a genuinely interdisciplinary research setting and share a strong interest in the topic of recommender systems. Ideally, they will focus on one or more of the following areas:
- fairness in recommender systems;
- music recommender systems; or
- societal implications of recommender systems.
