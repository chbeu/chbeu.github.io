Christine Bauer is a Professor of Interactive Intelligent Systems at the Department of Artificial Intelligence and Human Interfaces (AIHI) at the Paris Lodron University Salzburg (PLUS), Austria. In this role, she is part of the Excellence in Digital Sciences and Interdisciplinary Technologies (EXDIGIT) initiative. Since 2024, she is a Co-Lead of the focus area "InterMediation. Music---Effect---Analysis" at the inter-university institution Wissenschaft & Kunst.

Her research activities center on interactive intelligent systems, where she integrates research on intelligent technologies, the interaction of humans with intelligent systems, and their interplay. Thereby, she takes a human-centered computing approach, where technology follows humans’ and society’s needs. Recently, she worked on (context-aware) recommender systems in the music and media domains. Core interests in her research activities are fairness and multi-method evaluations. 

Her multidisciplinary background drives her research and teaching activities. She holds a Doctoral degree in Social and Economic Sciences (Business Informatics) (2009, with honors) and a Diploma (equivalent to a Master's) degree in International Business Administration (2002), both from the University of Vienna, Austria. Furthermore, she holds a Master's degree (MSc) in Business Informatics (2011) from TU Wien, Austria. Further studies at the University of Wales Swansea (now: Swansea University), United Kingdom, the Konservatorium der Stadt Wien (now: MUK---Music and Arts University of the City of Vienna), Austria, and WU Vienna (Vienna University of Economics and Business), Austria.

Throughout her academic career, she has held positions at various institutions in four countries, including Assistant Professor at the Department of Information and Computing Sciences at Utrecht University, The Netherlands (2020--2023). Senior Postdoc Researcher (Elise Richter laureate) at the Institute of Computational Perception at Johannes Kepler University Linz, Austria (2017--2020). Postdoctoral Researcher at the Department of Information Systems and Information Management at the University of Cologne, Germany (2015--2016). Visiting Fellow at the Human-Computer Interaction Institute, Ubicomp Lab, at Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA (2013 and 2015). Assistant Professor at the Department of Information Systems and Operations at WU Vienna (Vienna University of Economics and Business), Austria (2009--2015).
Furthermore, she engaged in applied research as a Researcher at the E-Commerce Competence Center (EC3), Austria (2007--2009), and Junior Key Researcher at Fachhochschulstudiengänge Burgenland (University of Applied Sciences), Austria (2006--2007). Furthermore, she did freelance research, for instance, for the Research Studios Austria and the University of Vienna, Austria.
Before starting her academic career, she worked as a Manager Licensing New Media at Austria’s biggest collecting society AKM (Autoren, Komponisten, Musikverleger), Austria (2002--2006).

She is an experienced teacher in a broad spectrum of topics in computing and information systems, taught at 17 institutions across four countries: University of Klagenfurt, Austria (since 2025); Mozarteum University Salzburg, Austria (since 2024); Paris Lodron University Salzburg, Austria (since 2023); FH Salzburg, Austria (2023); Utrecht University, The Netherlands (2020--2023); University of Innsbruck, Austria (2019--2020); University of Vienna, Austria (2008--2018); Danube University Krems, Austria (2015--2017); University of Applied Sciences Technikum Wien, Austria (2016--2017); WU Vienna (Vienna University of Economics and Business), Vienna, Austria (2009--2015); Ferdinand Porsche FernFH Studiengänge (University of Applied Sciences with distance learning), Vienna, Austria (2009--2015). Guest Lecturer at Jönköping University, Sweden (2020--2021) and the Popakademie Baden-Württemberg (University for Music Business, Creative Industries and Popular Music), Mannheim, Germany (2012--2015).

She is on the Editorial Boards of ACM Transactions on Recommender Systems (TORS), ACM Transactions on Information Systems (TOIS), and Information Technology & Tourism (JITT). As an active member of the international scientific research community, she co-organized the workshops Reflections on Recommender Systems Past, Present, and Future (INTROSPECTIVES 2024) and 2nd Music Recommender Systems Workshop (MuRS 2024) at RecSys 2024, the workshop series Perspectives on the Evaluation of Recommender Systems (PERSPECTIVES) at RecSys 2021--2023, and the Workshop on Intelligent User-Adapted Interfaces: Design and Multi-Modal Evaluation (IUadaptMe 2019) at UMAP 2019. Further, she has co-organized Dagstuhl seminars related to evaluation in recommender systems and information retrieval. Besides her teaching activities at the ACM Summer School on Recommender Systems 2024, 2023, and 2019 as well as ESSIR 2024, she gave tutorials at UMAP 2021 and ISMIR 2022. Furthermore, she was a chair of the Doctoral Symposium at RecSys 2023 and 2021 and served in the same role at the PhD Symposium at CIKM 2023.
