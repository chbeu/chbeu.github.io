Christine Bauer is a Professor of Interactive Intelligent Systems at the Department of Artificial Intelligence and Human Interfaces (AIHI) at the [University of Salzburg](https://www.plus.ac.at), Austria, and a Co-Lead of the focus area [InterMediation. Music---Effect---Analysis](https://w-k.sbg.ac.at/en/intermediation-music-effect-analysis-2024-28/) at the inter-university organization Wissenschaft & Kunst.

Her research activities center on **interactive intelligent systems**, whereby she integrates research on intelligent technologies, the interaction of humans with intelligent systems, and their interplay. She takes a **human-centered computing approach**, where technology follows humans’ and society’s needs. Recently, she has focused on context-aware **recommender systems** and concentrates on recommender systems in the music and media sectors in particular. Core interests in her research activities are **fairness** in algorithmic decision-making and **multi-method evaluation**.   
<!-- She co-organized the workshop series ["Perspectives on the Evaluation of Recommender Systems (PERSPECTIVES)"](https://perspectives-ws.github.io). -->
She advocates equal opportunities, is a member of the [working group on equal opportunities (AKG)](https://www.plus.ac.at/akg/), and engages in initiatives such as [Widening Inclusion in Music Information Retrieval (WiMIR)](https://wimir.wordpress.com), the Allyship program at CHI, and [LEA (Let's empower Austria)](https://letsempoweraustria.at/role-model/christine-bauer/).
