summary: 3rd Music Recommender Systems Workshop (MuRS 2025), co-located with RecSys 2025.
abstract: "Music recommendation has been relevant to the RecSys community since its early days. With the growth of music streaming platforms in the last twenty years, algorithmic recommendations have become critically important for the music industry. However, many challenges remain in the area of music recommender systems. For this third edition of the workshop, the key motivation is the growing impact of generative content on music recommendation. The rapid influx of AI-generated music is reshaping the streaming landscape, raising critical questions about discoverability, authenticity, and the role of recommender systems in curating such content. The challenges and opportunities associated with AI-generated content in music platforms are currently being addressed in diverse research communities beyond RecSys and the Music Information Retrieval (MIR) community. However, today, there is no forum where all these challenges are discussed jointly. The RecSys conference has traditionally not focused very much on music content understanding. On the other hand, while music content understanding is central to the MIR community, research on recommender systems is less prevalent in MIR research compared to other topics. This leaves a research gap between the two communities. The Music Recommender Systems Workshop (MuRS) aims to bridge the gap between the diverse research communities focused on the specific challenges of music recommender systems. The workshop will provide a space for researchers and practitioners from multiple disciplines to jointly discuss and exchange perspectives and solutions, and promote discussion from both academia and industry regarding future research directions in music recommender systems."
