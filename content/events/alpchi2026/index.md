The idea for AlpCHI was first discussed within the SIGCHI Switzerland chapter of the ACM, building on a long-standing idea by Denis Lalanne to establish such a conference. Whether as an independent event or by hosting established SIGCHI conferences such as MobileHCI, DIS, CHI or others, AlpCHI provides a regional forum that is accessible, community-driven, and fosters collaboration. The goal is to create a sustainable conference landscape while strengthening the local HCI community. A defining feature of AlpCHI is its commitment to inspiring locations. Each conference will take place within a 50 km radius of a mountain that is at least 2,026 metres (each year adding one meter) above sea level, offering participants the opportunity for a scenic hike before or after the event.
